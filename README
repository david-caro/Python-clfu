This is a little python library to acess the commandlinefu
(www.commandlinefu.com) api.

Each query gets you 25 results (at max) so you must handle paginig or you can
use the iterator to get as many results as you want (careful! each 25 results
will send a petition again to the commandlinefu website, don't do a for loop
to get all the results because that can saturate the server, try always to
paginate them)

An example of usage:

clfu = CLFu() 
## get the tags fom the website, it gets them from the tagcloud on the main
## page, so it will fail if the webpage changes :(, but there is no better way
## yet (if there is please tell me!)
tags = clfu.get_tabs()

## get the first 25 commands that match the word 'disk'
cmds = cflu.search('disk')

## get all the commands that were posted during the day
cmnds = [cmnd for cmnd in cflu.browse_all(timerange='last day')]
## NOTE: the browse_all and search_all commands are iterators

The available options for each command request method (browse, browse_all,
search, search_all, using, using_all) are:

 timerange: the timerange to looks the commands into ('anytyme' - default,
           'last day', 'last week', 'last month'))
 
 sort: How to sort the commands ('date' - default, 'votes')

 form: How the results will be returned ('json' - default, this parses the
       response and returns a python list, the others return the raw page (to
       be implemented), 'plain' and 'rss')
 
 page: the page number to start looking from, 0 by default.


Enjoy!
pd: it is used in the clicompanion software
(https://launchpad.net/clicompanion) for the CommandLineFU plugin.
